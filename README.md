# Download DFA / DCM Recurring Reports Easily
This is a very simple way to download DFA reports. No runtime options, few dependencies, just <b>raw download power.</b><br><br>

1 - set up a (recurring) report on your DFA dashboard<br>
2 - Set up config.py with your creds, profile_id and report_id<br>
3 - Run. It will pull a list of report and download those that aren't in the "csv" subfolder<br>
