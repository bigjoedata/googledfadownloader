# Download DFA / DCM Recurring Reports Easily
This is a very simple way to download DFA reports. No runtime options, few dependencies, just raw download power.

1 - set up a (recurring) report on your DFA dashboard
2 - Set up config.py with your creds, profile_id and report_id
3 - Run. It will pull a list of report and download those that aren't in the "csv" subfolder
